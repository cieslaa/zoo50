A web application for animal species classification, built as a final project for Harvard's [CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/) course.

Upload a photo of an animal, and the app will identify its species using a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) model from Hugging Face.
